SIMRacingApps Release Notes
---------------------------

Version: 1.0_Build_2016.07.07
    1. This is the initial release of the SIMRacingApp's Suite.
    2. As a first release, I only have it working with 1 SIM, iRacing.
       Other SIM plug-ins will be developed at a future date.
    3. Also, full International support is built in, but there are no translations as of yet. 
       So, I'm looking for volunteers to translate the text to other languages.
    4. BETA testing has been occurring over the last 9 months and I feel like the software is very stable.
       But, nothing is perfect. Please use the issues list at http://issues.SIMRacingApps.com, to report
       any problems. You will have to create a GitHub account to do so.
    5. If you just have some questions, please join the SIMRacingApps group on FaceBook and post your
       question there. It can be found at http://facebook.com/groups/SIMRacingApps.

    1. To get the server running, simply execute the SIMRacingAppsServer...exe 
       on the same computer that the Simulator is running on.
    2. If you do not have Java 1.8 or better installed, it will redirect you to the Java download page.
       NOTE: This page will install the 32-bit version of Java. The 64-bit is faster.
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/Java-64-Bit-Installation.
       Also see http://wiki.SIMRacingApps.com/Java-Update-Configuration 
       for detailed instructions on how to configure Java's Automatic Updates so it doesn't interrupt your racing.
    3. Enter the server address (found in the Title Bar of the server window) in your browser 
       from any device connected to the same local network.
       Connecting from outside the local network is not supported and not recommended due to security concerns.
    4. Please refer to the Quick Start Guide at http://quickstart.SIMRacingApps.com
       for more details and options for running the server.

        WARNING: 
            THERE IS AN OVERWOLF BUG THAT CAUSES IT TO TAKE OVER YOUR USB INPUT DEVICES
            WHENEVER YOU CLICK ON AN APP. THIS CAN CAUSE IT TO SHIFT DOWN, LOOSE FORCE FEEDBACK,
            AND OTHER DISASTROUS THINGS. SO, DO NOT CLICK ON AN APP WHILE IN THE CAR.
            If you do, go into the garage and come back out and it will reset your devices.
            I have posted the issue to the forums.
