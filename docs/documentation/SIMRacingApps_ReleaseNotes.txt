       diff between at start/finish doubles for about a second 
    2. Updated the Dallara DW12 profile. The Oil and Water Level meters needed adjusting.
    3. Minor color adjustment to the FuelTank widget to show a Green background
       on the numbers if you already have enough fuel in the tank to finish, Yellow if you have enough 
       room in the tank to get what you need to finish at the next pit and Red if you cannot
       add enough fuel to finish (More stops will be needed).
    4. Added an option to the Flags widget to not show the messages, just the flags.

****************** Previous Versions *************************

1.0_Build_BETA-2016.05.15
    1. Added new Relative widgets that displays only the cars in your class.
       Thanks to Mark Hargett at HPP Simulations for this enhancement. 
       If you're not in a multi-class session, it will display all cars.
    2. Added new widget called LapsBanner that includes just the left box from the StandingsBannder.
       This can be customized separately from the Standings Banner if needed using LapsBanner.json.
       Thanks to Robert Moyer Jr for this enhancement.
    3. Changed how the volume works so that the "sound-volume" setting effects all other volumes relatively.
       Before, the "sound-volume" was only used if the "pit-count-down-volume" was not set.
       Now, if "sound-volume=.8" and "pit-count-down-volume=.5" the final volume will be .4
       This will allow you to control the level of all sounds with the "sound-volume" setting and use the 
       volume for each sound to balance the levels between each other.
       If you have both of them set now, you will want to adjust them for this new logic.
       I decided to make this change because it's the way a sound board works and I didn't want to get any grief :)
       More sounds will be coming in the future.
       Thanks to Robert Moyer Jr for this enhancement.
    4. Added the ability to totally disable sound with the following entry in settings.txt.
       The default is true.
          sound = false
    5. You can now stop the MSPEC Shift RPM Light from turning on when speeding on pit road.
       Set the following variable in your settings.txt file. The default is true.
          mspec-speeding = false
    6. Added slow blink when Pit Limiter is on for MSPEC RPM Light, Tachs, and ShiftLights.
    7. ShiftLight and ShiftLights widgets now turn on when speeding on pit road by default.
       There is also a version without it on the menu.
    8. Added new API call, /Session/ClassNames, to get all the car classes in the session.
    
1.0_Build_BETA-2016.04.25
    1. Removed the previous code that reset the fast repair option on pit exit for iRacing.
       As of the March 30, 2016 patch from iRacing, this is controlled by setting 
            Documents\iRacing\app.ini[Pit Service]autoResetFastRepair
    2. Fixed issue with StandingsBanner widget where it would not page through
       the field when under caution.
    3. Added the Chat Widget with customizable buttons.
       To customize, you add variables to your settings. See the documentation for Chat for details.
          chat-row1-col1-name = /[CAR]<br />PASS LEFT
          chat-row1-col1-text = /RL-1 [#[CARNUMBER]] Pass Left
       NOTE: What is RL-1? That is the code for Relative 1 position behind.
    4. Fixed Relative so it doesn't show the pace car if it is not on the track.
    5. Added Car/(CARIDENTFIER)/NumberFont and Car/(CARIDENTFIER)/NumberSlant to the API.
       Changed the CarNumber widget to use them. If the font is not installed on your system
       it falls back to Arial. I will be investigating ways to bundle the fonts, if I can get 
       permission to. 

1.0_Build_BETA-2016.03.24
    1. Added ability for SIMPluginCallbacks to add to the ReST API.
       For example, to set the volume after the server has started on the Sounds.PitCountDown plug-in use:
       http://{Your.IP.Address}{:port}/SIMRacingApps/Data/SIMPluginCallback/Sounds/PitCountDown/setVolume/70
    2. Updated AngularJS to 1.5.0
    3. Updated Jetty to 9.3.7.v20160115
    4. Added a Time Widget. You can display local time with or without the time zone. And there is a GMT variant.
    5. Car TRANSMITTING lookup now checks TeamSpeak and matches based on the car number and nickname.
       The number and name must match exactly. The number can be at the beginning or the end prefixed with a #.
       If someone is talking in the SIM, it will take priority, then teamspeak.
    6. New Car Models for March 2016 Build. iRacing got the shift lights all wrong. 
       You will need to update to this version of SRA get the correct ones.
       - Audi R8 LMS
       - Formula Renault 2.0 
       - Mazda MX5 Cup
       - Mercedes AMG GT3
    7. Added option to Relative widgets to show only cars either On Track or On Pit Road
       depending on where you are.
    8. Added 2 new DriverInfo widgets for the Position Ahead/Behind In Class.
    9. Fixed position in the DriverInfo title to be by class.
    10. Added new widget Messages. This widget can display up to 3 messages from the SIM.
    11. Fix bug where estimated values, such as, laps to go, laps of fuel, time remaining, 
        were using lap times from non-green flag laps. Mostly noticed near cautions.
    12. Added code to turn off the Fast Repair check box after pitting by default. 
        To leave the check box to what the SIM sets it to, add this to the settings.txt file.
            gauge-fastrepairs-autoreset-off = false
    13. Added support for setting the font size in the StandingsBanner widget.
        Added "fontSize" attribute to the StandingsBanner.json file. 
        {
            "title":            "DAYTONA 500",
            "fontSize":         "100%", 
            "sponsorImageUrls": ["Sponsors/Sponsor1.png","Sponsors/Sponsor2.png"],
            "sponsorSeconds":   [60,120]
        }
    14. Now turns off the Fast Repairs flag when you leave the pits, if you are using a PitControlled App.
    15. Added the ability to disable a built in SIMPluginCallback by prefixing the name
        in the settings.txt file with an exclamation point(!).
        Example, this will not load the Sounds.PitCountDown plug-in.
           simplugins = !Sounds.PitCountDown
    16. Retired ATI for "/Session/Flags" and replaced with the following.
    17. New API paths
       /Session/IsGreenFlag
       /Session/IsCautionFlag
       /Session/IsCheckeredFlag
       /Session/IsCrossedFlag
       /Session/IsWhiteFlag
       /Session/IsRedFlag
       /Session/Messages
       /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/IsBlackFlag
       /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/IsBlueFlag
       /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/IsDisqualifyFlag
       /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/Messages
       /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/PitTimes
       /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/StartFinishTimes
       /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/IsPitSpeedLimiter

1.0_Build_BETA-2016.02.25
    1. Another fix to the Pit-Count-Down. Sometimes it would call the numbers out of order
       when you sped up and slowed back down while it was counting.
    2. Fixed bug where time in pit stall would go blank for all drivers.
       When you rewind to look at the replay, when you go back live,
       the iRacing session time would go backwards. I was initializing the cache in this condition. 
       I added code to detect a new session a better way.
    3. Fixed bug where I had broken the ability to record the sessions.
    4. Increased max memory from 256mb to 512mb because when uploading updates, it needs to keep
       it in memory before extracting it. Min memory is still 256mb, so if you don't need it, it
       will not grow.

1.0_Build_BETA-2016.02.19
    1.  Added Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/DriverNameShort to the API.
    2.  Added new customizable widget called StandingsBanner that mimics the banner seen on TV.
        It is customizable with a StandingsBanner.json file placed in the "Documents/SIMRacingApps" folder.
        The Image URLs are relative to this folder as well.
        The sponsor files should use the aspect ratio of 4x1. 
        The default window size calculates that to be 200x50 pixels.
        Whatever the size, it will scale it to fit.
        Also, any image format your browser supports can be used, such as, .jpg, etc.
        Here is the format of the StandingsBanner.json file:
        {
            "title":            "DAYTONA 500",
            "sponsorImageUrls": ["Sponsors/Sponsor1.png","Sponsors/Sponsor2.png"],
            "sponsorSeconds":   [60,120]
        }
    3.  Fixed bug where the "sound-volume" setting did not work, 
        if you did not specifically set the "pit-count-down-volume".
        Now you will be able to control all the sounds with the master setting.
    4.  Added new App called StreamingOverlay. 
        It is a preconfigured overlay to be used with the CLR Browser Plug-in in OBS.
        You can also run each widget individually from the CLR Browser,
        just add the "&BACKGROUNDCOLOR=transparent" to the URL.

1.0_Build_BETA-2016.02.13
    1. PitRoad: Added visual blinking when within 10 seconds of your pit stall. Closes #1 issue.
    2. Server: Added a audible count down to your pit stall.
       This can be controlled with the following variables in the settings.txt or command line args.
       You sound device names are printed out in the server window when it first starts up.
      1. pit-count-down-device = A Sound Device Name
      2. pit-count-down-volume = 1.0  #from 0 to 1
      3. pit-count-down-start  = 5    #from 0 to 10
      4. pit-count-down-play10 = Y
      5. pit-count-down-play0  = Y
      6. pit-count-down-pattern= {path to spotter pack}
        1. # some known patterns to spotter packs. Your version may vary. Double backslashes are required.
           # %d is the place holder for the number.
        2. C:\\Program Files (x86)\\iRacing\\sound\\spcc\\JJ Spotter Pack v6.51\\n%d.wav
        3. C:\\Program Files (x86)\\iRacing\\sound\\spcc\\Dale Jr Spotter Pack v2.4\\n%d_A1.wav
    3. Added a global setting for sound in the settings.txt and command line args.
      1. sound-device = A Sound Device Name
      2. sound-volume = 1.0   #from 0 to 1
    4. Fixed bug where the pit timer would reset if the car blinked out or was on the very edge of the pit stall.
    5. Added ability to use the DataTable widget in a favorite.
    6. Time Remaining, in a non-time bound session, is now estimated based on the leader's average laps.
    7. Added a tilde(~) after Time Remaining and To Go Laps if they were estimated based on lap timing.
       So if you are in a timed session with a limited number of laps, you can see which limit is driving the end of the race.
       
1.0_Build_BETA-2016.01.30
    1.  Add new API call for Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/IsBelowMinimumSpeed.
        - Updated the Relative, Standings, DriverInfo Widgets to draw a red box around the driver's name.
        - On the TrackMap widget, I put a black "X" on the car.
        - The maximum lap time allowed is calculated by averaging the last 3 green flag laps 
          of the leader multiplied by 110%.
        - If a car's last 3 consecutive green flag laps since pitting are all above the maximum, 
          then it is marked as below the minimum speed.
        - The variables can be configured by entering the following values in the 
          "Documents/SIMRacingApps/settings.txt" file.
           minimum-speed-laps         = 3
           minimum-speed-laps-leader  = 3
           minimum-speed-percentage   = 110
    2.  Created a StandandingsTop43 Widget and updated the Spectator/Broadcaster App to use it.
    3.  Team Events, fixed issue where the PitCommands were going out even if you were not in the car.
        Also, when you got in the car, it would reset everything to your requests instead of the previous
        drivers requests. In my case, my app.ini, was set to start with nothing selected.
    4.  Multi-class, all Apps that show "Behind" calculations, now base that off of the leader for your class.
        Previously, it as based on the overall leader. I also added the class color as the background.
    5.  FuelTank widget got a face lift. Now all of the values in the table can be turned off individually.
        See the next new feature, favorites.
    6.  Favorites: A new section on the menu called "favorites".
        - At some point, I will add the ability to save and modify a favorite from the menu.
          But for this release, I have created a sample favorite that you can download from releases page.
        - Upload this file to your instance of SIMRacingApps through the main menu.
          This will create a file in "Documents/SIMRacingApps/favorites/MyFuelTank.json" that you can edit.
        - You can copy this file and modify it to make other favorites.
        - To find the options a Widget supports, see the documentation for that widget.
          It will list the parameters. If they are in the format of "data-sra-args-some-option",
          to add that option to the favorite, put it in the "args" variable by stripping off "data-sra-args-"
          and remove any remaining hyphens. The result would be "&SOMEOPTION=value".
          Don't worry, I will make a user friendly interface for favorites at some point.
    
1.0_Build_BETA-2016.01.18
    1.  Demoted Yellow,YellowWaving and Blue flags from the Session level to the Car level. 
    2.  Fixed bug where the CarSelector was not working in the Spectator App.
    3.  Overhauled the Overwolf-Apps. Added ability to have multiple configurations. 
        I now provide a .opk file to install with instructions updated in the readme. 
        Later I will submit this to the Overwolf Store for download.
    4.  Added option to disable TeamSpeak from updating your nickname with your car number.
        The new option is "-teamspeak-carnumber = true" for the command line or settings.txt.
        Also, when not in a session, the car number is removed from your nickname if this option is true.
    5.  Added ability to have multiple configurations to Electron-Apps.
        The side effect of doing this is your previous settings could not be converted over. 
        This was because not all of the settings were being saved in the storage folder. Now they are.
        Go through the menu and select the LoadOnStartup option again and click the logo to refresh.
    6.  Made the track on the TrackMap with no background darker.
    7.  Added -mspec-eflag option to control MPEC's new 3 color light.
        Changed the MPSPEC options to reflect what they do, not the light they turn on.
        The original options will still be honored.
            -mspec-red    is now -mspec-rpm
            -mspec-yellow is now -mspec-yellowflag
            -mspec-green  is now -mspec-greenflag
            -msepc-blue   is now -mspec-blueflag
    8.  Added new App called Dash-Minimum which is a condensed version of Dash-Small.
    9.  Fix bug where the gauges would not change when loading iRacing with a car with different ranges.
        Only happened between certain cars, but it is fixed now.
    10. Split up the Spectator and Broadcaster App on the Menu.
        Spectators cannot change the Reference Car. (Let your household members use this one while you're racing).
        Broadcasters can change the Reference Car.
    11. Relative and Standings Widgets, Display TeamName if in a Team Session, else Club.
    12. Fixed the Chevrolet Corvette C7 increment for fuel. Was 1.3 gal, should have been 1 gal.
    13. If the session is multiclass, then the background of the manufacturer logos will change to the classes color.
        Also in the Track Map, the cars will have a ring around them that is the class color.
        
1.0_Build_BETA-2015.12.26
    1.  Added MSPEC option -mspec-rpm that does the same thing as -mspec-red.
    2.  Creates a default settings.txt file in the Documents/SIMRacingApps folder on server startup.
        Also added ability to edit the settings from the Main Menu by clicking the gear icon.
    3.  Fixed the Indy TrackMap Images.
    4.  Added Support for Overwolf Apps. You can download the overwolf-apps.sra to use them.
    
1.0_Build_BETA-2015.12.19
    1.  Added Browse SIM Raw Data to the main menu.
    2.  Added ability to override the shift light RPMs in the settings.txt file.
        You can override by track, car, gear and engine power.
        Track, Gear and Power are optional.
        The format is as follows:
            [{track}-]{car}-ShiftLightStart[-{gear}][-{power}] = rpm
            [{track}-]{car}-ShiftLightShift[-{gear}][-{power}] = rpm
            [{track}-]{car}-ShiftLightBlink[-{gear}][-{power}] = rpm
        You must specify all 3 values (start,shift,blink) or they will be ignored.
        Start is where the first light in a row of lights should come on.
        Shift is where the last light will come on and should also be your shift point.
        Blink is after Shift and it's where the light will blink.
        {track} and {car} are the values the SIM returns. Spaces are converted to underscores. 
        You should be able to find these values in the server output window.
        Here is an example I used for testing with some bogus values:
            stockcars_chevyss-ShiftLightStart = 6000
            stockcars_chevyss-ShiftLightShift = 7000
            stockcars_chevyss-ShiftLightBlink = 8000
    4.  Received MSPEC Shift Light and tested. 
        Port number is defined in the Documents\SIMRacingApps\settings.txt file or the command line.
    5.  Up to date with the iRacing December 2015 Build.
        a. Track Maps for Nurburgring, Southern National.
        b. Car Profile for McLaren-Honda MP4-30.
        c. Now can track PSI/kPa changes to Tires Setup before Pitting.
        d. Now can display the Right Rear and Left Rear Wedge Adjustments.              
    6.  Changed the Main Menu to load the App with the ICON instead of the name.
    7.  Now you can run the Apps and Widgets using Atom/Electron instead of your browser.
        Download the electron-apps.sra file and upload it to the server from the main menu.
        There are instructions in the download folder.
        It uses a startapps.bat with a list of apps. But it has other options as well.
        It uses the names listed on the main menu.
        This should replace the need to use Chrome Apps.
    8.  Users can now add items to the main menu by creating a .json file in their Documents\SIMRacingApps\favorites folder.
        The electron-apps will use these as well as .json files found in the electron-apps folder.
        Here is an example. Create a file called "DriverInfo-ME.json" with the following contents.
        {

1.0_Build_BETA-2015.12.05
    1.  Added new app Dash-Small for smaller devices.
    2.  Added new app Dash-Gauges-Spek-Horizontal.
    3.  Now all command line arguments can also be put in a settings.txt file in your Personal folder.
        This allows you to run the server without having to create a shortcut to pass in the options as arguments.
        Put one argument per line. Example(s):
           level=FINE
           log=MyLog 
           mspec-red=3
    4.  Added compatibility for Chrome's "Apps" desktop web application platform. 
        iOS and Android have "Add to Home Screen" in their browsers, and now your Chrome Desktop does also. 
        You can also add your App or Widget as a shortcut to Chrome's "Apps" Button.
        Why, because this allows it to remember size and location of when it was last closed.
        You can also write a .bat file to start several Apps all at once.
        How to Step by Step:
           A. Open the App or Widget from the main menu that you want to create a shortcut for.
           B. Right Click on the title bar and select "Show as Tab".
           C. Click Chrome's Menu button (3 horizontal bars) and go to "More Tools -> Add to taskbar".
              Select the "Open as Window" check box, name it, and click "Add".
           D. Click on Chrome's "Apps" button.
           E. Now you can run the App or Widget from the chrome://apps page.
           F. If you don't want to open Chrome to run an App, then Right Click on the icon to create a shortcut.
              Shortcuts can be put on the Desktop, Start Menu, or Task Bar for you to run later.
              Shortcuts can also be called from a .bat file and started all at once, including the server. 
              Here's the syntax:
                  start SIMRacingAppsServer....exe
                  @rem give the server 10 seconds to get started, and a small sleep between each app
                  @ping localhost -n 10 -w 1000 >nul
                  start Name1.lnk
                  @ping localhost -n 2 -w 1000 >nul
                  start Name2.lnk
                  @ping localhost -n 2 -w 1000 >nul
    5.  Also updated the chrome-apps folder, which you can extract from the .exe file with 7-Zip.
        There's a readme file explaining how to use them. They are basically the same as basic 
        Chrome App, but with more controls. I can hide the title bar and make it stay on top.         
    6.  Made the default ReST interface default output to be a "pretty" formatted string.
        So, as a developer, I recommend you always specify an output format because "pretty" is slow.
        For detailed documentation, go to http://localhost/SIMRacingApps/JavaDoc/com/SIMRacingApps/servlets/Data.html
        Try these to see the difference:
            http://localhost/SIMRacingApps/Data/Car/REFERENCE/Description
            http://localhost/SIMRacingApps/Data/Car/REFERENCE/Description?output=json
        You can also see all the data a particular SIM is outputting, but only recommended for debugging.
        Here is an iRacing example:
            http://localhost/SIMRacingApps/Data/iRacing
            http://localhost/SIMRacingApps/Data/iRacing?output=json
    
1.0_Build_BETA-2015.11.23
    1.  Updated the default fuel capacity and capacity increment to 4 decimal places. 
        There were some rounding issues in a session that was 50% fuel.
    2.  Fix an issue where the TimingDelta widget was hidden on the Dash-StockCars-DigitalOverlay App.
    3.  For you technical folks, updated the JNA library from 4.0.0 to 4.2.1.
    4.  Change the colors so you have to be on pit road to get a dimmer color.
        When you are approaching the pits, you can still go back onto the track.
        Helps to know for sure that the car is pitting, or at least driving down pit road.
    5.  Changed Personal folder to be in the user's "My Documents\SIMRacingApps" folder instead of the user's home folder.
    6.  Found duplicate resources in the exe file. Removed them, reducing size over 60MB :)
    7.  Changed the Logo and Icon images to Gary Whitson's design. Thanks Gary.
    8.  Made some changes to the MSPEC code to try and get it working before my own light gets here.

1.0_Build_BETA-2015.11.16
    1.  Added SHOWMAP option for TrackMap widget to show the background or not.
        Also added TRACKMAPCARS option so you can select what cars to show.
    2.  Standings Top 10,20,35 now highlights the fastest times in the BEST and LAST columns.
        LAST only considers cars 2 laps down or less.
    
1.0_Build_BETA-2015.11.14
    1.  Updated the CrewChief-Large App to include the RadioControl widget along with some rearranging of the existing widgets.
    2.  Changed the StandingsTop20 and StandingsTop35 to show you at the bottom if you are not within range.
    3.  Added a StandingsTop10 Widget, that will show you at the bottom if you are not in the top 10.
    4.  Put the Fuel Tank widget on the main menu.
        Added a checkered pattern to the fuel needed to finish background.
        Now it should be more obvious that is what it is for.

1.0_Build_BETA-2015.11.13
    1.  Fixed the Street Stock Profile. A missing comma prevented it from loading the gauges.
    2.  Changed the "LapsToGo" API call to factor in the remaining time in the session
        and reduce it to the number of laps that can be run based on the leader's time in a race
        and your time in other types of sessions. The fuel needed calculation now uses this value as well.
    3.  Added support for the MSPEC Shift Light. You can get them here, http://shiftlight.com.au
        Each light can be configured on a different comm port, so you have to tell me which port the light(s) is/are on.
        Use the following arguments to enable the lights you have.
           -mspec-red {portnumber}
           -mspec-green {portnumber}
           -mspec-blue {portnumber}
           -mspec-yellow {portnumber}
        Example: "SIMRacingAppsServer_1.0_Build_BETA-2015.11.13.exe" -mspec-red 3 -mspec-yellow 4
                 You should right click, create short cut, and add these to the end of the "Target" field.
                 Then use the shortcut to launch the server. Remember to update your shortcut when you download new versions.
    4. Also added a ShiftLight widget for a virtual display of the a shift light. 
       It only implements the "red" light with On/Off/Blink.
    5. Added RadioControl widget for selecting the radio channel to talk on.
       You can also delete channels, if allowed, such as the ones you have added.
       I was going to add mute/unmute for each channel (if allowed), but iRacing has a bug and it doesn't work correctly.

1.0_Build_BETA-2015.11.07
    1.  Added support for Fuel in weight (kg or lb). The hpdarx01c and williamsfw31 both use weight.
    2.  Added support for shift light ranges to be defined by car, track, gear, and engine power map.
        Updated all car profiles that didn't match what iRacing was giving me using baseline setup at Texas. 
        I didn't test all tracks, so report to me if the lights don't match iRacing and I'll update the profile for that car/track.

1.0_Build_BETA-2015.11.02
    1.  Added code to stop and wait for the user to press ENTER if a fatal error occurs starting the server.
    2.  Moved the Car Selection grid in the Race Administrator to be it's own widget called CarSelector.
        When used by itself, will change the REFERENCE car.
    3.  Added a Perspective option to the WindGauge widget to rotate like a compass to the direction
        of the car's bearing. Added this widget to the Dashes.
    4.  Added new Spectator / Broadcaster App to show information you would want to know when you are just watching.
        It displays a grid of car numbers that can be clicked to change the perspective to that car.
        The perspective is global across all running apps on the same server.
        So, if anyone else in your home is spectating while you're racing, they should not
        change the prospective/reference car away from "ME".  
    5.  Added CarImage widget to display an image of the car if the SIM supports sending it to me.
        Currently iRacing will not display the current car number, so I turned it off for now.
    6.  Now all cars found on iRacing has a profile. Many new gauges were created to support them.
        Note: Cars with fuel in weight is not supported yet by the API.
              Also, cars with real-time tire temps and pressures are not supported yet by the API.
    
1.0_Build_BETA-2015.10.27
    1.  Added profiles for dallara, v8 super cars that were added to the base content on iRacing.
        Crew Chief, PitCommander, added display of Front/Rear Wing adjustment gauges.
    2.  Added AntiRoll(Front/Rear), WeightJacker, In Car gauges to dashes.
    3.  Added support for "Add to Home Screen" option on iOS(Safari) and Andriod(Chrome) browsers.
        After launching an App or Widget, select the "..." (Chrome) or "Box with Up Arrow" (Safari) and choose add to home screen.
        Next time you can launch it from the home screen and it will run full screen.
    4.  Added support for the SIM to tell me what unit of measure to use.
        Implemented 3 new units of measures that can be used by the user as well, (NATIVE,METRIC,IMPERIAL).
    5.  Added Class and Qualifying Positions to the Lap Timing, Standings and Relative Apps.
    6.  Added Delta column for position changes on the StandingsTop20 and StandingsTop35 widgets.
    
1.0_Build_BETA-2015.10.14
    1.  Added new App called Race Administrator that can send the admin commands when hosting a race.
        Just click the command to make it active, then click the car numbers to send that command to.
    2.  Added Manufacturer Logo's to several widgets.
    3.  Added ability to upload a ZIP File for adding new Apps, Widgets or Patches that have been shared by the community.
        The ZIP File will be extracted into your user directory, which defaults to %USERPROFILE%\SIMRacingApps.
    4.  Added new ReST service called /SIMRacingApps/sendkeys. This follows the Visual Basic syntax of the SendKeys class.
        Example to change the right front in iRacing: /SIMRacingApps/sendkeys/{ESCAPE}t{DELAY 100}rf{ENTER}
        I recommend not using the service directly if you want your apps to work with other SIMs.
    5.  Added several new methods to the generic API for sending admin commands to the SIM.
        /Session/setAdvancedFlag, /Session/setChatFlag/(Y/N), /Session/setCautionFlag
        /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/setChatFlag/(Y/N), setAdminFlag/(Y/N), setBlackFlag/(TIME)/(S/LAP), 
        setDisqualifyFlag, setRemoveFlag, setWaveAroundFlag, setEndOfLineFlag, setClearPenaltiesFlag
    6.  Added Fuel Tank widget to the Bar Gauges App.

1.0_Build_BETA-2015.10.03
    1.  Merged the Server Installation docs into the Getting Started Docs. There is no server installation.
    2.  Added support for the new TrackTempCrew variable that will be released in Dec 2015 of iRacing.
        It will be updated real-time throughout the race as an average of several points on the track.
    3.  Added Super Late Model profile and new Brake Pressure Gauge to go with it.
        You probably didn't know it was there, because it is near the floor in the middle of the car.
    4.  Added a Bar Gauge widget for all gauges.
    5.  Added a Shift Lights widget and the rev lights on the Analog Tachometer now show shift lights as well.
    6.  Added a new Dash that uses then new Bar Gauge and Shift Lights widgets.
    7.  Fixed Wind Direction bug where sometimes it would display the degrees instead of "E".
    8.  You can now pass the "lang" argument to the main menu to override the browser language.
        http://{IP}?lang=de
        At this point, it will only control the formatting of numbers and dates. Nothing has been translated.
    9.  Added a new App called Crew Chief Large for 8 inch or larger displays so more information can be displayed.
        7 inch may be OK, but nothing smaller is readable.
    10. Fixed iOS bug where the clickable items could not be clicked.

1.0_Build_BETA-2015.09.23
    1.  Added documentation on how to bypass the .exe and run java manually in the Server Installation documentation.
    2.  Added -userpath command line option to allow user to change from the default of %USERPROFILE%\SIMRacingApps.
        This would allow users to have multiple directories for live and development of their own Apps and Widgets.
        This supports multiple directories separated with with a semi-colon, just like PATH does.
    3.  Switched the internal Web Server from Tomcat to Jetty because it works better from the .exe
        and Jetty has better documentation on how to get Web Sockets working in that mode.
    4.  Added showPath option to the Track Map widget to draw the outline of the course.
        This can be disabled with a URL parameter &SHOWPATH=false;
    5.  Added all the profiles for track configurations along with some new API methods for track information. 
    6.  Added all the profiles for cars I own. 
        See list of cars above that need information about their gauges and telemetry outputs.
    7.  Added support for gauge values, ABS, Traction Control, Front and Rear Wing, Left and Right Wedge.
    8.  Added support for dynamic weather and track temp.
    9.  Now uses the new Pit telemetry values to update the CrewChief App real-time when you make selections via the blackboxes.
    10. Added new state to gauges called NOTAVAILABLE. Used it to hide values the car is not outputting on CrewChief and Dash Apps.
    11. Added profile for X-Finity Toyota Camry.

1.0_Build_BETA-2015.08.17
---------------------
    1. Change threading model to get better performance when a lot of clients are connected.
    2. Fixed TeamSpeak Interface from crashing.
    3. Changes to put everything in one EXE file. Accepts command line options, -port, -level, -log.
       Also supports passing options to Java via an INI file created in the same folder as the EXE.
       For example, to change the memory used, create a file with the same name as the EXE, but remove
       the EXE and add ".l4j.ini". Then edit the file and add the following contents.
         -Xms512m
         -Xmx512m
    4. Added support for users to create Apps and Widgets in their own "%USERPROFILE%\SIMRacingApps" folder.
       This also means that to create or override a track or car model file, 
       put them in "%USERPROFILES%\SIMRacingApps\com\SIMRacingApps\Tracks" 
       and "%USERPROFILES%\SIMRacingApps\com\SIMRacingApps\Connectors\iRacing\Cars"
       and restart the server.
    5. Fix bug where incrementing/decrement tire pressure in open setups were not working.
    
1.0_Build_BETA-2015.07.24
-------------------------
    1. Initial Release
    2. This version does not contain a profile for all cars, only the cars I use on a regular basis.
       The default profile is based on the Class A Cup Car, then these profiles override the differences.
       To see what cars have a profile, look in SRA_DIR\webapps\SIMRacingApps\WEB-INF\classes\com\SIMRacingApps\Connectors\iRacing\Cars.
    3. This version does not have all the tracks and configurations modeled.
       To see what tracks have been modeled, look in SRA_DIR\webapps\SIMRacingApps\WEB-INF\classes\com\SIMRacingApps\Tracks.
