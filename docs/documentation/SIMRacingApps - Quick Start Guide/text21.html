<h1>Credits / Biography</h1>
<ul>
<li>Many, many thanks to my Wife. She has been so understanding with my “minor” obsession with SIM Racing and this software development effort.</li>
<li>I also need to thank my Beta testers.</li>
<li>I started with iRacing in 2010 after a friend recommended it to me. I was a user of NASCAR 2003 and was saddened when they went under. </li>
<li>I’ve been developing software for over 25 years now and I still thoroughly enjoy it. But, I have to admit, I would rather be SIM racing :). It has been a delicate balance of time as I also have a real job.</li>
<li>My background is mostly in Unix using C, C++ and Java on the server side. Recently in the corporate world, Oracle PL/SQL on the server side as well. I have had a few projects that required some client side (UI) development, but not many. This endeavor started as an effort to increase my client side skills. I originally wrote a version in Perl for Windows, but this lacked the performance I was looking for and it wasn't server based. Next I decided to write it in Java, with intention of doing the clients in Java as well. Then it hit me, why not create a HTTP server where you can use JavaScript and HTML5 to build the Apps. So, here we are. Hope you enjoy using it as much as I have enjoyed creating it.</li>
