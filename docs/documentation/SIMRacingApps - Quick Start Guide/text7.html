<h1>Apps / Widgets</h1>
<ul>
<li>SIMRacingApps is broken down into 2 categories, Apps and Widgets.</li>
<li>Apps are really just a collection of Widgets configured specifically for the App.</li>
<li>Widgets are small subsets of functionality that are self contained by their own right. Some of the Widgets could just as well have been an App, but I decided to create them as Widgets so they can be used in an App with other Widgets at the same tiem.</li>
<li>Widgets can also be made up of other Widgets, for example the Car Controls Widget uses the Pedals, Steering Wheel and Gear widgets.</li>
<li>For details about each App or Widget, from the main screen, click on the image on the left. To run them, click the text.</li>
<li>If you are interested in building your own App or Widget, see the links to the documentation for doing so in the documentation section on the main menu.</li>
<li>On the following pages is a sampling of some of the most significant Apps/Widgets available. There are more on the main menu and even more if you look in the Java Script documentation.</li>
</ul>
