<h1>What does it cost? Who is this for?</h1>
<ul>
<li>The cost is free. By making it free, if hope to get participation from other developers to really make SIM racing better for everyone. Source code to the JavaScript/HTML clients is included. But for now, I do not plan release the source code to the server until my Generic API becomes more mature.</li>
<li>This is for anyone wanting to get more information from their SIM to help them make better decisions and possibly even go faster. There are some Apps and Widgets that simply mimic functionality already provided by the SIM. But, those were only created as a baseline to be improved on. There are several Apps and Widgets to choose from.</li>
<li>Only the server has to be running on the same computer as the SIM and I have found it doesn’t affect the SIM’s performance. The server can handle connections from many clients. I routinely run 7 clients.</li>
</ul>
