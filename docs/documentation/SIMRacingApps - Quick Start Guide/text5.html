<h1>Browsers</h1>
<ul>
<li>All major browsers are supported as long as they conform to the HTML5 specification. I routinely use Google Chrome while developing. Then I double check that each App or Widget works in the other browsers, but not every time I make a change.</li>
<ul>
<li>Google Chrome Latest version, on all devices</li>
<li>IE10 or Greater including EDGE</li>
<li>FireFox Latest version</li>
<li>Safari on iO. I do not have a MAC, so it may work.</li>
<li>Android stock browser may not support the SVG tag used by some widgets, use Chrome instead.</li>
</ul>
<li>Full Screen mode varies on the different browsers as well as switching between tabs. When running an App or Widget from the Main Page, it will either open a new browser window or browser tab, depending on how you have your browser configured. You can run multiple Apps and/or Widgets at the same time. You can also add the App or Widget to your home screen on iOS and Andriod to get a full screen experience. On Chrome for Windows, you can create shortcuts as well. See the “<a href="#Creating a Chrome Shortcut">#Creating a Chrome Shortcut</a>” page below for details.</li>
<li>All Apps and Widgets should re-size themselves to the size of your browser view-port. They should also re-size and reposition themselves if the device is rotated as well. I found that most browsers on phones and tablets will auto hide their header and footer if the page needs to scroll (or add them to the home screen). Since the SIMRacingApps clients adapt to the current view, the browser does not think it needs to scroll. To work around this, pinch out a little bit to make it bigger, then slowly push it up and most browsers will hide the decorations and re-size the page.</li>
<li>The other thing to note, when using phones and tablets, is to turn off the auto lock or other battery saving features and plug them it so the device's display will stay on. How to do this varies from device to device. On Android, if you don't have the option in Settings → Display → Sleep for “None”, then you can use an App called “Stay Alive”.  You can also put the Android in developer mode, then there is a no sleep option in the developer settings.</li>
</ul>
