<li>The CrewChief App is used to make all your pit stop decisions. In the screen shot, the “red” items indicate what will be changed on the next pit stop. </li>
<li>Using a mouse or touch screen, you can click on the red or green items to change them. This screen shot is shown in fixed setup mode with the controller option set to true. But, in an open race, you can also change the tire pressures from the App.</li>
<li>If the SIM supports it, SIMRacingApps will send the commands to the SIM to make the changes. If not, it will show you what you have changed in the SIM if the SIM sends it out.</li>
<li>To add a full tank of fuel, click or touch on the blue area of the fuel tank. Once the fuel has burned off, you can click above the blue to add to the point you clicked or touched.</li>
<li>The number laps you can go on the remaining  fuel is displayed. Not shown here is a gray area that visually shows how much fuel is needed to finish the race. If the area is within the blue, you are good to the finish.</li>
