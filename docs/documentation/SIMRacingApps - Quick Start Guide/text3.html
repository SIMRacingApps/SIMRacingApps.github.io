<h1>Starting the Server</h1>
<ul>
<li>Download the SIMRacingAppsServer....exe, if you have not already, from my OneDrive folder ( <a href="http://1drv.ms/1LCTFnI">http://1drv.ms/1LCTFnI</a> ) and save it in a place where you can find it later. I suggest saving it to your desktop or your documents folder. This should be done on the same computer where the SIM will be running.</li>
<li>There is no installation required. All you need to do is double click on the SIMRacingAppsServer....exe you downloaded or the shortcut to it (if you created one). This will open a window where you can see the output from the server. In the title bar of this window, the HTTP address of the server will be displayed. You will use this address in the browser to connect to the server. This window can be minimized, but you should not close it while the SIM is running.</li>
<ul>
<li>Note: If it opens your browser to the Java Download page, it means you don't have the correct version of Java installed. Install Java and run the server again.</li>
<li>I recommended you turn off automatic installation of updates for Java in the Control Panel, Java -&gt; Update tab. You don't want it updating while you are racing. It has caused black screens when it updates while racing. Change it to notify you before downloading and change the time it checks to when you are not likely to be racing. Also, on the Java -&gt; Security tab, you can disable Java in the browser if you don't need it for any other website. I do recommend you stay up to date, just do it manually.</li>
</ul>
<li>To enable TeamSpeak integration, you must enable the Client Query Plug-in in the TeamSpeak options of the TeamSpeak client. Then SIMRacingApps will auto append your car number to your alias automatically and pop up who's talking on some of the apps.</li>
</ul>
