<h1>Sharing Your App or Widget</h1>
<ul>
<li>Now that you have created a masterpiece, you want to share it. The recommended way is to open Windows Explorer and navigate to the &quot;%USERPROFILE%\SIMRacingApps&quot; folder, right click on the “apps” or “widgets” folder and select &quot;Send To -&gt; Compressed (zipped) Folder&quot;. If you are working on multiple Apps or Widgets, you will want to modify the zip to contain only the one(s) you want to share. The path in the .zip file should be relative to the &quot;%USERPROFILE%\SIMRacingApps&quot; folder.</li>
<li>Then rename the .zip file to .sra and instruct them to upload it using the Upload form at the bottom of the main menu. If you included a listings.json file, it will be included in the SIMRacingApps main page automatically.</li>
<li>I will also be willing to evaluate your App or Widget to be included with the standard distribution, if it meets my quality requirements.</li>
</ul>
