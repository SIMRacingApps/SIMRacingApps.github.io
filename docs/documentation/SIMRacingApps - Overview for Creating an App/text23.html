<h1>Sharing Your App</h1>
<ul>
<li>Now that you have created a masterpiece, you want to share it. The recommended way is to open Windows Explorer and navigate to the &quot;%USERPROFILE%\SIMRacingApps\apps&quot; folder, right click on your App's folder and select &quot;Send To -&gt; Compressed (zipped) Folder&quot;.</li>
<li>Then send them the .zip file and instruct them to extract it to their &quot;apps&quot; folder. If you included a listings.properties file, it will be included in the SIMRacingApps main page.</li>
<li>I will also be willing to evaluate your App to be included with the standard distribution, if it meets my quality requirements. (TODO: document them).</li>
</ul>
