------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. To get the server running, simply execute the SIMRacingAppsServer...exe 
       on the same computer that the Simulator is running on.
    2. If you do not have Java 1.8 or better installed, it will redirect you to the Java download page.
       NOTE: This page may install the 32-bit version of Java. The 64-bit version is faster.
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/Java-64-Bit-Installation on how to find it.
       Also see http://wiki.SIMRacingApps.com/Java-Update-Configuration 
       for detailed instructions on how to configure Java's Automatic Updates so it doesn't interrupt your racing.
    3. If a Firewall is running, you might get prompted to allow the server to run.
       Depending on if your Ethernet connection was made private or public, 
       you may be asked to confirm that also. Please select allow.
       If your Firewall doesn't prompt you, then you will have to add an exception to allow "java.exe"
       for both in-bound and out-bound traffic on all ports. 
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-fix-Firewall-issues for more information.
    4. Enter the server address (found in the Title Bar of the server window) in your browser 
       from any device connected to the same local network.
       Connecting from outside the local network is not supported and not recommended due to security concerns.
    5. To use the Electron client with the Apps/Widgets overlaid on top of the SIM, you 
       must have the SIM running in Windowed mode. Please see the following Wiki info to configure the SIM.
       https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-setup-iRacing-in-Windowed-Mode
    6. Please refer to the Quick Start Guide at http://quickstart.SIMRacingApps.com
       for more details and options for running the server.
    
    Wiki:
        There are many other recommendations on the SIMRacingApps Wiki at http://wiki.SIMRacingApps.com.

       It is not linked to a certified authority, but it should prevent tampering with the exe.
       
    2. When a session has limited laps and it is timed, 
       display the lesser of TimeRemaining and EstimatedTimeRemaining.

    3. Closed #154 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/154)
       Voice Attack command for returning weather information
       Added "whats the weather". Thanks to Ricky Thompson for the submission.

       CarNumber: Add ability for user to provide PNG file
       Images will expand, but best to use aspect ratio of 1.6 or (800x480)
       Path: Documents/SIMRacingApps/CarNumbers/LeagueID-{leagueId}/{carNumber}.png

    5. Closed #153 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/153)
       REFERENCE car should follow who the camera has selected.
       Can be turned on/off in settings using (reference-camera = y/n)
       
    6. Added widgets for displaying the SRA logo so streamers can show SRA some love.
       SRALogo, SRALogoURL
       
    7. Updated Jetty Engine from 9.3.7 to 9.4.9 to get rid of Java 10 warnings.
    
    8. Fixed #159 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/159)
       Electron: When Apps become visible, a hidden task bar will unhide and stay there.
       This occurred when using the new visible feature as well as "show all" command
       from Voice Attack. This hides the apps from the task bar. 
       If you don't have this problem and you wish to see them on the task bar,
       add this to your settings to turn it back on.
           electron-showappsontaskbar = Y
           
    9. Created a CameraSelectorVertical30 which shows the CarSelector widget on the bottom.

    10. Closed #152 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/152)
        Store the lowest & highest positions per driver/class
        Added these to the API in the first 1.7 BETA
            /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/PositionLowest
            /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/PositionHighest
            /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/PositionLowestClass
            /Car/(CARIDENTIFIER)/PositionHighestClass
            
    11. On the Main Menu, disabled the "Upload" button until a file was chosen.
        Thanks to Steve Kubay for reporting this. It was putting you in a place you could not back out of.
        
    12. Fixed the Speedometer value on the other cars.
           
    13. Closed #163 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/163)
        Lotus79 & 49 Fuel not showing in Imperial Gallons
        
    14. New PlugIn to use LIFX Lights for the Flags. http://lifx.com.
        To enable the lights, follow the instructions found at 
        http://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/LIFX-Lights-Setup
        Thanks to Gary Whitson for providing me with a unit to test with.
        
    15. Added option to auto start your browser on the SIMRacingApps menu
        if you are not going to be auto starting Electron.
        I added it to the default settings to be true for new users.
        Existing users will have to add the following to their settings.
           browser-autostart = Y

    16. Fixed the shift points on the Ferrari 488 GT3 car. They were too low.
