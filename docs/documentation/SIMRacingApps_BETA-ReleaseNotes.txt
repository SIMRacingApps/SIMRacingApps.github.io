Version: 1.6_Build_BETA-2018.02.01

    1. Fixed #136 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/136)
       VoiceAttack, Start Gear Announcement, setting SRA_loop false still loops.
       Change to use local variables.
       The preferred way to disable a spotter loop, is to remove it from the "Start Spotter" command
       
    2. Fixed #141 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/141)
       Invalid Characters in the UserName causes server to crash
       This fixes Brian Wertman's and Don Runkle Jr.'s issues where SRA would only crash on Sunday nights.
       Turns out, the league he runs on Sunday, the admins were putting invalid characters in the UserName.

    3. Closed #101 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/101)
       Add option to all widgets to autohide
       Electron 4.x was enhanced to allow users to select when an app/widget should be visible.
       Options are when: NotConnected, InCar, InGarage, InReplay
       These options are saved with your configuration.
       
    4. Fixed favorites to allow https URLs.
    
    5. Closed #138 (https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/issues/138)
       Electron: Ability to click through the transparent areas
       What this means is if you need to move or resize an Electron widget, 
       you will need to turn off transparency, move/resize, then turn it back on.
       You can disable this feature by adding "electron-noclickthrough=y" to the settings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. To get the server running, simply execute the SIMRacingAppsServer...exe 
       on the same computer that the Simulator is running on.
    2. If you do not have Java 1.8 or better installed, it will redirect you to the Java download page.
       NOTE: This page may install the 32-bit version of Java. The 64-bit version is faster.
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/Java-64-Bit-Installation on how to find it.
       Also see http://wiki.SIMRacingApps.com/Java-Update-Configuration 
       for detailed instructions on how to configure Java's Automatic Updates so it doesn't interrupt your racing.
    3. If a Firewall is running, you might get prompted to allow the server to run.
       Depending on if your Ethernet connection was made private or public, 
       you may be asked to confirm that also. Please select allow.
       If your Firewall doesn't prompt you, then you will have to add an exception to allow "java.exe"
       for both in-bound and out-bound traffic on all ports. 
       See https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/wiki/How-to-fix-Firewall-issues for more information.
    4. Enter the server address (found in the Title Bar of the server window) in your browser 
       from any device connected to the same local network.
       Connecting from outside the local network is not supported and not recommended due to security concerns.
    5. Please refer to the Quick Start Guide at http://quickstart.SIMRacingApps.com
       for more details and options for running the server.

        There are many other recommendations on the SIMRacingApps Wiki at http://wiki.SIMRacingApps.com.
